# Intuitions about RRE form

## Systems with non-unique solutions

Solve for the variables $x, y$, and $z$ in the system

$$
\begin{aligned}
z & =2 \\
x+y+z & =2 \\
2 x+2 y+4 z & =8
\end{aligned}
$$

. . .

Make an augmented matrix: Example 1.20. Solve for the variables $x, y$, and $z$ in the system

$$
\left[\begin{array}{llll}
0 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\
2 & 2 & 4 & 8
\end{array}\right]
$$

::: notes
Note that the first column corresponds to x, the second to y, and the third to z.
:::

. . .

$$
\left[\begin{array}{llll}
0 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\
2 & 2 & 4 & 8
\end{array}\right] \stackrel{E_{12}}{\longrightarrow}\left[\begin{array}{llll}
(1 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
2 & 2 & 4 & 8
\end{array}\right] \xrightarrow[E_{31}(-2)]{\longrightarrow}\left[\begin{array}{rlll}
1 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 2
\end{array}\right]
$$


::: notes
Now we are stuck! The first row we are going to use to solve for x. Neither the second or third row tell us anything about y...
:::


##

We keep on going...
$$
\begin{aligned}
& {\left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
(1) & 1 & 1 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 2
\end{array}\right] \xrightarrow[E_{2}(1 / 2)]{\longrightarrow}\left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
1 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 2
\end{array}\right]} \\
& \overrightarrow{E_{32}(-1)}\left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
(1) & 1 & 1 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right] \xrightarrow[E_{12}(-1)]{\longrightarrow}\left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
(1) & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right] .
\end{aligned}
$$

There's still no information on $y$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x=-y \\
& z=2 \\
& y \text { is free. }
\end{aligned}
$$

## Free versus bound variables

Suppose we have another augmented matrix, which after GJ elimination has become:

$$
\left[\begin{array}{rrrrr}
x & y & z & w & \mathrm{rhs} \\
1 & 2 & 0 & -1 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 3 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right] .
$$

. . .

Solutions are:
$$
\begin{aligned}
x+2 y-w & =2 \\
z+3 w & =0 .
\end{aligned}
$$

How can we tell from looking at the matrix which variables are free vs bound?

Columns which contain *pivots* correspond to bound variables. The others correspond to free variables. 

(Columns with pivots are called "basic" columns.)

## Zero solutions

Solve this system...
$$
\begin{array}{r}
x+y=1 \\
2 x+y=2 \\
3 x+2 y=5 .
\end{array}
$$

. . .

$$
\left[\begin{array}{lll}
1 & 1 & 1 \\
2 & 1 & 2 \\
3 & 2 & 5
\end{array}\right] \xrightarrow[E_{21}(-2)]{E_{31}(-3)}\left[\begin{array}{lrl}
1 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & -1 & 0 \\
0 & -1 & 2
\end{array}\right] \xrightarrow[E_{32}(-1)]{\longrightarrow}\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
1 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & -1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 2
\end{array}\right]
$$

::: notes
We didn't even finish the G-J elimination, but there's clearly a problem. We can't have 0 = 2.
Maybe not a surprise, since we have three equations with only two unknowns!
:::

. . .

System is **inconsistent**.


## Consistency

For an augmented matrix in RREF, if the only only nonzero entry in a row appears on the right-hand side,

$$\text { Row } i \longrightarrow\left(
\begin{array}{cccccc|c}
* & * & * & * & * & * & * \\
0 & 0 & 0 & * & * & * & * \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & * & * & * \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \alpha \\
\bullet & \bullet & \bullet & \bullet & \bullet & \bullet & \bullet \\
\bullet & \bullet & \bullet & \bullet & \bullet & \bullet & \bullet
\end{array}
\right) \longleftarrow \alpha \neq 0 
$$ 


the $i^{\text {th }}$ equation of the associated system is

$$
0 x_{1}+0 x_{2}+\cdots+0 x_{n}=\alpha .
$$

If $\alpha\ne 0$, this has no solution!

This is an **inconsistent** system.

::: notes
Note that there is *not* inconsistency if there is a row of all zeros.

## What Reduced Row Echelon Form tells us

Suppose a matrix $A_{m \times n}$ has a reduced row echelon form $E_{m \times n}$:
$$ E_A=\left(\begin{array}{cccccccc}1 & * & 0 & 0 & * & * & 0 & * \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & * & * & 0 & * \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & * & * & 0 & * \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & * \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\end{array}\right)$$


::: notes
What can we learn from the RREF of a matrix? What does it tell us? It can tell us which variables are free vs bound, and therefore how *many* variables are bound. (This is the rank of the matrix!)
:::






## Which variables are free and bound

Suppose a matrix $A_{m \times n}$ has a reduced row echelon form $E_{m \times n}$:
$$ E_A=\left(\begin{array}{cccccccc}1 & * & 0 & 0 & * & * & 0 & * \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & * & * & 0 & * \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & * & * & 0 & * \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & * \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\end{array}\right)$$



"Basic columns" correspond to  the columns in $A$ which contain the pivotal positions. 

Each non-basic column can be formed as a sum of the basic columns to the left.

Basic columns are the same in $E$ and $A$!

## Rank

Suppose a matrix $A_{m \times n}$ has a reduced row echelon form $E_{m \times n}$:
$$ E_A=\left(\begin{array}{cccccccc}1 & * & 0 & 0 & * & * & 0 & * \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & * & * & 0 & * \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & * & * & 0 & * \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & * \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\end{array}\right)$$



*rank($A$)* = \# of pivots = \# of nonzero rows in $E$ = \# *bound variables* in the system

## Nullity

Suppose a matrix $A_{m \times n}$ has a reduced row echelon form $E_{m \times n}$:
$$ E_A=\left(\begin{array}{cccccccc}1 & * & 0 & 0 & * & * & 0 & * \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & * & * & 0 & * \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & * & * & 0 & * \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & * \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\end{array}\right)$$

*nullity($A$)* = \# of non-pivot columns = \# *free variables* in the system

## Consistency


Equivalent ways of saying $A$ is consistent:

-   In row reducing $[\mathbf{A} \mid \mathbf{b}]$, a row of the following form never appears:
  
 . . .
$$
\left(\begin{array}{llll|l}
0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & \alpha \tag{2.3.2}
\end{array}\right) \text {, where } \alpha \neq 0 \text {. }
$$

-   $\operatorname{rank}[\mathbf{A} \mid \mathbf{b}]=\operatorname{rank}(\mathbf{A})$, in which case either:
    - $\operatorname{rank}[\mathbf{A}=n$, and system has a unique solution or
    - $\operatorname{rank}[\mathbf{A}<n$, and system has infinite solutions

-    $\mathbf{b}$ is a nonbasic column in $[\mathbf{A} \mid \mathbf{b}]$.


-   $\mathbf{b}$ is a combination of the basic columns in $\mathbf{A}$.

## Homogeneous Systems

- The general linear system with $m \times n$ coefficient matrix $A$ and right-hand-side vector $\mathbf{b}$ is **homogeneous** if the entries of $\mathbf{b}$ are all zero. 

- Otherwise, the system is **inhomogeneous**.

- Homogeneous systems are always consistent!

- Can solve by setting all variables to zero. This is the **trivial solution**

- If rank of the matrix = n, there is *only* the trivial solution

# Example + tutorial: Pagerank

## Pagerank

Goal: rank pages in terms of "importance". Suppose we have four pages:

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_02_16_adbe27593182d62240abg-020.jpg?height=307&width=436&top_left_y=682&top_left_x=541)

::: callout
How can we rank these pages? Which one is most important?
:::

::: notes
First try: count number of backlinks. But that can be artifically inflated (just link to a page many times), and it doesn't care about importance of the linking page.

Second try:
For page $i$ let $x_{i}$ be its score and $L_{i}$ be the set of all indices of pages linking to it.   Then 
$$
\begin{equation*}
x_{i}=\sum_{x_{j} \in L_{i}} x_{j}
\end{equation*}
$$

But it's still easy to game this system, by setting up a page and making a ton of outgoing links to pages we want to promote.

Third try: 
For page $j$ let $n_{j}$ be its total number of outgoing links on that page. Then score is

$$
\begin{equation*}
x_{i}=\sum_{x_{j} \in L_{i}} \frac{x_{j}}{n_{j}} 
\end{equation*}
$$

## Working through PageRank: try 3

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_02_16_adbe27593182d62240abg-020.jpg?height=307&width=436&top_left_y=682&top_left_x=541)

$$
\begin{equation*}
x_{i}=\sum_{x_{j} \in L_{i}} \frac{x_{j}}{n_{j}} 
\end{equation*}
$$

::: callout
Write down the system of equations this gives us. Then make it in an augmented matrix.
:::

::: notes
$$
\begin{aligned}
& x_{1}=\frac{x_{2}}{1}+\frac{x_{3}}{3} \\
& x_{2}=\frac{x_{1}}{2}+\frac{x_{3}}{3} \\
& x_{3}=\frac{x_{1}}{2}+\frac{x_{4}}{1} \\
& x_{4}=\frac{x_{3}}{3} .
\end{aligned}
$$

Augmented matrix:

```{python}
import sympy as sym
P = sym.Matrix([[1,-1,-1,0,0],[-1,1,-1,0,0],[-1,0,1,-1,0],[0,0,-1,1,0]])
P
```

:::

## Now what about the second try?

Remember this was our 'second try':
$$
\begin{equation*}
x_{i}=\sum_{x_{j} \in L_{i}} x_{j}
\end{equation*}
$$

This was the system of equations.
$$
\begin{aligned}
& x_{1}=x_{2}+x_{3} \\
& x_{2}=x_{1}+x_{3} \\
& x_{3}=x_{1}+x_{4} \\
& x_{4}=x_{3} .
\end{aligned}
$$

What happens if we try to solve this? Try it in Python.

::: notes
What happens is that we get only the trivial solution. This makes sense because it is a homogeneous system with full rank.

# Diffusion

## Discretizing continuous functions



-   Rod with fixed temperatures $y_{left}$ and $y_{right}$ at each end, internal heat source given as $f(x), 0 \leq x \leq 1$

-   What's the temperature at each point along the length?

## 

<center>![Discrete approximation to temperature function $(n=5)$](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_02_16_adbe27593182d62240abg-017.jpg?height=411&width=612&top_left_y=508&top_left_x=453) </center>



::: notes
-   equally spaced points, called nodes, $x_{0}=0, x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n+1}=1$, distance $h$ apart.
-   heat on the $i$ th segment $\approx$ temperature at its left node.
-   temperature is $y(x)$, $y_{i}=y\left(x_{i}\right)$.
-   
:::

. . .

Equations to balance the flow of heat from each node to its neighbors:

$$
\begin{equation*}
-y_{i-1}+2 y_{i}-y_{i+1}=\frac{h^{2}}{K} f\left(x_{i}\right) 
\end{equation*}
$$

---

Suppose:

- rod of material with $K=1$ on  x-axis, for $0 \leq x \leq 1$.
- known internal heat source $f(x)$
- left and right ends of the rod are held at $0{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (degrees Celsius)
- $n=5$ nodes

. . .

What are the discretized steady-state equations?

. . .

::: {.notes}
- $x_{i}=i h$. 
- $y_{0}$ is given to be 0, dissapears
-  $y_{n+1}=y_{6}$ =0,Thus we have from equation (1.2) five equations in the unknowns $y_{i}, i=1,2, \ldots, 5$
:::

$$
\begin{array}{lllllr}
2 y_{1}&-y_{2}  & & & & =f(1 / 6) / 36 \\
-y_{1}&+2 y_{2}&-y_{3} & & & =f(2 / 6) / 36 \\
&-y_{2}&+2 y_{3}&-y_{4} & & =f(3 / 6) / 36 \\
&&-y_{3}&+2 y_{4}&-y_{5} & =f(4 / 6) / 36 \\
&&&-y_{4}&+2 y_{5} & =f(5 / 6) / 36
\end{array}
$$

::: {.notes}
This is already a pain to work with by hand!
:::

##

Build the matrix representing the system of equations:

```{python}
#| echo: true
N=6
M = sym.zeros(N)
for i in range(N):
  if (i>0):
      M[i-1,i]=-1
  M[i,i]=2
  if (i<N-1):
      M[i+1,i]=-1
M
```

##

$$
\begin{equation*}
-y_{i-1}+2 y_{i}-y_{i+1}=\frac{h^{2}}{K} f\left(x_{i}\right) 
\end{equation*}
$$

Decide on a function for f. Let's say $\frac{h^{2}}{K} f = x_i^2$.

Say that x is running from 0 to 1. Then we can have

```{python}
#| echo: true
import numpy as np
x=np.arange(0,1,1/N)
f=x**2
x=sym.Matrix(x)
f=sym.Matrix(f)
```

##


```{python}
#| echo: true
sol=M.gauss_jordan_solve(f)
sol[0]
```

## Now you
1. Implement this yourself in Python
2. Make a plot of the output (you'll want to use PyPlot)
3. Increase N and make more plots
4. This was assuming the temperature at the ends was 0. How can we change this?
